Use the Top plane for the outline (XY) and extrude thickness along +Z.\n\nTarget dimensions: handle 160 mm long (X direction), 18 mm wide (Y), 6 mm thick (Z). Head outer diameter ~36 mm located at the +X end. Jaw opening 14 mm, jaw depth 12 mm.\n\nBuild: 1) sketch handle+head outer outline on Top and extrude 6 mm (NEW). 2) sketch jaw cut on Top and REMOVE THROUGH_ALL. Validate with onshape_snapshot_partstudio and ensure bbox is roughly x~160mm, y~36mm, z~6mm.",
