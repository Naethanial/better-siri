Place one at Y: 16..20, the other at Y: -20..-16. Extrude each wall 20 mm high with operation ADD so it merges with the base.\n\nHoles: diameter 6 mm. Base holes at (x=-30 mm,y=0) and (x=30 mm,y=0). Wall holes: on each wall add two holes at x=-20 mm and x=20 mm centered in the wall thickness (y=18 or y=-18) and around mid-height; use separate hole sketches on Top plane and REMOVE THROUGH_ALL (approx is fine).\n\nValidate with onshape_snapshot_partstudio; bbox should be about x~120mm, y~40mm, z~20mm.",
