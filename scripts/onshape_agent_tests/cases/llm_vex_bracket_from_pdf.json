  "prompt": "Use the attached drawing to model the main L-bracket/plate as a simple, competent parametric part. Ignore tiny fasteners/gear teeth; focus on the bracket and its major holes. Use explicit mm units.\n\nIf the drawing is too ambiguous to measure: assume common VEX plate standards as a fallback (do NOT stop): thickness 3.175 mm (1/8 in), hole diameter 5.0 mm, hole spacing 12.7 mm (0.5 in).\n\nFallback starting geometry (make this first, then adjust if the drawing contradicts it):\n1) Base plate: rectangle 150 mm x 80 mm centered at origin (x from -75 mm to 75 mm, y from -40 mm to 40 mm) extruded 3.175 mm (NEW).\n2) Vertical plate: sketch on Front plane a rectangle 150 mm (x -75..75) by 60 mm (y 0..60) and extrude thickness 3.175 mm (ADD) to form an L shape.\n3) Holes: create separate hole sketches and do REMOVE THROUGH_ALL. Put a simple 4x2 hole grid on the base plate: x = [-38.1, -12.7, 12.7, 38.1] mm, y = [-12.7, 12.7] mm, radius 2.5 mm.\n\nValidate with onshape_snapshot_partstudio and iterate if the model is obviously the wrong scale.",
